# RCT-adjusting-for-covaritates
Why it is better to adjust, Bayesian and frequentist. 

RCT-adjusting-for-covariates.Rmd 

Simulation is used to invesigate power for a treatment effect using both adjusted and unadjusted analyses and both Bayesian and frequentist analyses using STAN.

RCT-adjusting-for-covariates with a predictive biomarker.Rmd  

Here, we perform an investigation of adjusted and unadjusted power in the setting of RCT when there is a
predictive biomarker; a predictive biomarker is one which potentially provides information that can help to
guide treatment decisions. We go on to analysis the simulated trial using frequentist and Bayesian approaches.


need to check and make clear if it is the map or map2stan function that I am using
